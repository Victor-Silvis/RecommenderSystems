# RecommenderSystems
A collection of various recommender systems that can be used to suggest items to users. These systems may use content-based filtering, where recommendations are based on the characteristics of items or users. Alternatively, they may leverage collaborative filtering, identifying connections between users based on implicit patterns in user preferences.
